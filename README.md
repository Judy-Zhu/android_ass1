Author: Benjamin Wang, Judy Zhu

	-   Miles to Kilometers
	-   Meters to Yards
	-   Yards to Meters
	-   Meters to Feet

-   The assignment consists of two screens. On the first screen (InputActivity), the user decides on the conversion, enters an amount then clicks on the “Convert” button.

-   Results of the conversion are displayed on the second screen (OutputActivity ) in a user-friendly manner. For example: 32o Fahrenheit converts to 0o Celsius.

-   The second screen has a “Back” button that leads to the first screen.

-   Your application must cater to portrait and landscape orientations and must support an additional language to English.

-   If there are any technical details missing, try to make realistic assumptions and build on them

-   Use Android Resource files everywhere possible and avoid using literal strings/dimensions in the application

-   Make sure you set the minimum SDK to be 19
